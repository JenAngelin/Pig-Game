The Pig Game is a simple dice game often used to demonstrate programming concepts or as a fun, interactive project. The game can be played with two players, where the goal is to be the first to reach a predefined score (e.g., 100 points) by rolling dice and accumulating points.

**Rules of the Pig Game**

**Objective:**
Be the first player to reach the target score (e.g., 100 points).

**Gameplay:**
-> On a player’s turn, they roll a die (or dice).
-> The player has two choices after each roll:
      Roll Again: Risk it to gain more points.
      Hold: Save the current round's score and end their turn.
-> If the player rolls a 1:
      They lose all the points accumulated in the current round.
-> Their turn ends immediately.
-> Points from the current round are only added to the player’s total if they choose to Hold before rolling a 1.

**Winning:**
The first player to reach or exceed the target score (usually 100) wins the game.
